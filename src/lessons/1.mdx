- What is `Serial.println()`?
- You will make your own "hello world" code with the Arduino at the end.

## Lesson

The Arduino is a tiny computer that takes instructions from your computer and sends them to devices you connect to the Arduino. You can connect many types of devices to an Arduino, including LEDs, sensors, and input devices such as buttons. You can even attach an LED screen to display things!

### Pins/Components

There are many different Arduino boards, but we are focused on the Arduino UNO, the board in your kit.
