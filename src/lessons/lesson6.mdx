#### What is PWM? 
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PWM is how a digital pin can simulate analog output: this can be useful for setting an LED to something in the middle of off and full brightness<br/>
See the slide below:

<br/><br/>  
We can use PWM to do several things, but in this project we’ll use it to control a servo proportional to an ultrasonic sensor’s readings. 

<br/>
This is a **CHALLENGE** project, so you’ll be doing a majority of the coding and wiring for this project! We’ll give you a couple of hints and tips, but ultimately, executing the project is all up to you and your comprehension of the previous lessons. 

So what is the task?
  - We want you to design code that rotates a servo proportionally to the distance your hand is from an ultrasonic sensor. Refer to the code in the previous lesson for the ultrasonic sensor. 

  - We want you to do some of your own research on the Servo library that arduino provides, which is basically code that is already made which you can use to control a servo motor. 

  - Servo library reference: *[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/)*

  - Hint, you will need to use the `map()` function to convert the distance from the sensor to a rotational input to the servo, refer to *[this](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/math/map/)*

      ``` arduino

      #include <Servo.h>

        // make the servo object 
        Servo servo;


        #define echo Pin 2//D2 pinconnects to ECHO
        #define trigPin 3//D3 pinconnects to TRIG
        #define servoPin 9//D9 pinconnects to the servo input

        long duration; // time for ultrasonic wave to travel 
        int distance; // distance measurement
        unsigned int servoPosition = 0;

        void setup() {
          // setup ultrasonic pins 
          pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); 
          pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); 
          // setup servo
          servo.attach(9);
          servo.write(servoPosition); // set servo to 0 to start
          // setup serial communication 
          Serial.begin(9600);
        }
        void loop() {
          // get the distance from the ultrasonic sensor
          digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
          delayMicroseconds(2);
          digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH); 
          delayMicroseconds(10);
          digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
          duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
          distance = duration * 0.034 / 2; 
          Serial.print("Distance: "); 
          Serial.print(distance): 
          Serial.println(" cm");

          // use the map function to "convert" from cm to servo units 
          // expects distance values from Ocm-30cm
          // map will scale the distance (value between 0-30cm)
          // to a servo value (between 0-180)
          // feel free to change max distance to whatever work for your sensor 
          double maxDistance = 30; // in cm
          servoPosition = map(distance, 0, maxDistance, 0, 180); 
          servo.write(servoPosition);
          }
